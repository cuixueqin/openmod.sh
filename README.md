# **openMod.sh**: The open energy model for Schleswig-Holstein.

## Requirements

The following python packages have to be installed in order to use this:

  * flask
  * geoalchemy2
  * oemof.db
  * psycopg2
  * sqlachemy

As you can see, `openmod.sh` depends on `oemof.db`. Have a look at it's
[README][0] for information on how to configure database access.

Once you installed those, you can just do `python openmod.sh.py`.
