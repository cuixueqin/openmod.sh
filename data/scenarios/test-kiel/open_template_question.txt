General open question for terminology: 

* energy_sector vs. sector, energy_amount vs. amount?
* Inlcude 'units' as children of scenario?
* One emissions element per emission as a child of scenario element?
* For flexible generator only include 'output'-hub in hubs and define input
  hub from fueltype. Or only from fueltype if only one, i.e. the output hub is
  given? 
* variable_cost vs. variable_costs vs. marginal_cost ? 
* include price similar to emissions and units? (global prices instead of 
variable costs, or variable costs except fuel costs?)
* oemof_class / pypsa_class (keep as tag? or one level above?, not needed for template...)
